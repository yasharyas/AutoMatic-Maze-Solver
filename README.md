# YSC-Maze Solver (main.cpp)

YSC-Maze Solver is a C++ program designed to automatically solve mazes using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. The program can find the shortest path from the starting position (S) to the ending position (E) within a maze represented by a grid. The maze can consist of open paths (0), walls (1), and the solved path (2). For an enhanced user experience, the program provides colorful console output.
